Experiment:
any process whose outcome is subject to uncertainyy( and for which the possible outcomes can be identifies ahead of time)

Sample psace:
collecton of all possible outcomes of the experiment(notation=S)
  - infinite
    - countable
      - times  a neuron fires (0,1,2,3,...)
    - uncountable
      - wait time at a bus stop (0,infinity)
  - finite

Technical:
In general, for uncountable sample spaces, S, it is not possible to define Probabilities for all subsets of S
 - definition of "o-field"=collections of subsets of S (events) that satisfy three conditions which ensure consistent definition of Probability

toss a coin 3 times -> 2^3 outcomes
order matters
S={TTT,TTH,THH,HHH,....}

How many heads?

S={0,1,2,3}

Events:
subset of the sample space (notation: A,B,{A1,A2,A3,...An},{A1,A2,A3,...})

coin toss Experiment
until first heads is observed

S={H,TH,TTH,...} infinte tails before heads
infinite countable result

A=event=(first heads occurs after an odd number of coin tosses)

A= U si
 i odd

 Si=TT...TH
    | i-a|


Basic def from set theory

axiomatic def of Probability

Axiom 1
   For any event A, Pr(A)>=0

Axiom 2
   Pr(S)=1

Axiom 3 (countable additivity)
   For any countable sequence of disjoint events
   {A1,A2,...} (i.e. Ai (interection) Aj, for any i!=j)
   we must have

         infinte    infinite
      Pr(   U Ai) =   SUM   Pr(Ai)
           i=1        i=1
